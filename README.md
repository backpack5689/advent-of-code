# Advent of code

A folder of which I work through all the advent of code problems! 

I have broken this folder into years that I have competed.

I have also created a folder called "hello_worlds" that is just test programs in a multitude of different languages. This is intended to be used as a tester in order to be sure that you can run all of the programs on your computer, and that no additional packages are required.
