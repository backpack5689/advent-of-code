# adventofcode
A folder of which I work through all the advent of code problems!

I have broken this folder into years that I have competed, and then inside each, there will be the following files:
	<date>_<puzzle number that day>_program.<language extension>
	<date>_<puzzle number that day>_prompt.txt
	<date>_<puzzle number that day>_test.in
	<date>_<puzzle number that day>_test.out
	<date>_<puzzle number that day>_data.in
	<date>_<puzzle number that day>_data.out

I have also created a folder called "hello_worlds" that is just test programs in a multitude of different languages. This is intended to be used as a tester in order to be sure that you can run all of the programs on your computer, and that no additional packages are required.

For any questions on the programs I have created don't hesitate to reach out to me!
