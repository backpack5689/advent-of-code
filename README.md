# adventofcode
A folder of which I work through all the advent of code problems!

I have broken this folder into years that I have competed, and then inside each, there will be the following files:
	<date>_program
	<date>_prompt
	<date>_testin
	<date>_testout
	
I have also created a folder called "hello_worlds" that is just test programs in a multitude of different languages. This is intended to be used as a tester in order to be sure that you can run all of the programs on your computer, and that no additional packages are required.

For any questions on the programs I have created don't hesitate to reach out to me!
